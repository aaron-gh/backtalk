/**
 * Recognizes two fingers turning around each other, like turning a dial, and reports one step for
 * each [STEP_DEGREES] of rotation.
 *
 * The angle of the line between the two fingers is followed from the moment the second finger
 * lands. The rotation is accepted once that angle has changed by [COMMIT_DEGREES] while the
 * movement along the circle is larger than the movement of the midpoint (a two-finger scroll) and
 * the change of the distance between the fingers (a pinch). Until then the two-finger movement is
 * left to the caller. While [isPossibleRotation] is true, the caller should hold back scrolling or
 * passing the touch to the app. Once accepted, every event up to the last finger lifting belongs
 * to the rotation, and [onMotionEvent] returns true for them.
 *
 * Clockwise is clockwise as seen on the screen.
